Update Azure S2S vpn secret RRAS
================================

            

This script will find the Site to Site VPN secret and then update it in RRAS.


If you subscription expires or you use up too much credit then you need to recreate the Gateway and VPN, so you also need to update the secret.


This script might also be useful along side the Update-AzureS2SVPNEndpoint script that I have also uploaded.

TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
